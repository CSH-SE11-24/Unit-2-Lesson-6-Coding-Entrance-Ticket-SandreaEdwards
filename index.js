// In this entrance ticket, you will be building a "guess the number" game. 
// Create a new variable and put a number from 1-100 in


// Prompt the user to guess the number


// Cast the user input to a number



// Create a new variable called attempts and set it to 0


// Create a while loop that runs while the user guess is not equal to your number


// In the while loop, prompt the user to guess the number again (remember to cast)


// In the while loop, increase the attempts by 1


// In the while loop, write an if statement that does the following
// If the user guess is higher, say "Too high!"
// If the user guess is lower, say "Too low!"
// If the user guess is right, say "You got it!"




// After the while loop, print "It took (attempts) attempts"
